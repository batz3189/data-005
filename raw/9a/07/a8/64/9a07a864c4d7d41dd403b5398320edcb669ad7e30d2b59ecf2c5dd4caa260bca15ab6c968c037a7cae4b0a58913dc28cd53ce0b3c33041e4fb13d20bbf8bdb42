\viewkind4\uc1\pard\f0\fs20 This is a list of Unix programs. Some of these programs are standard utilities that will be found on any Unix or Unix-like operating system; indeed a system without such basic components as ls, sh and ed could scarcely be described as truly Unix-like. Others are more special-purpose and may not be installed by default but may be available as ready-to-install third party packages. Finally, some items on this list are simply separate applications which happen to have been written for Unix.\par

Many MS-DOS commands are similar to, or based on these commands. See List of DOS commands for more information.\par
